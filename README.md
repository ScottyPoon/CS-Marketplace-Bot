  - Set a minimum ROI for item withdrawals
  - Set a minimum or maximum price threshold for item withdrawals
  - Set a minimum liquidity threshold for item withdrawals
  - Set a specific float range for item withdrawals
  - Set a blacklist of item(s) you don't want to withdraw
  - Use session cookie for authentication â€“ no need for username and password.
